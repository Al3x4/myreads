# Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program
## Project 7 - MyReads 

This is a digital bookcase manager with React.

### Description
The user can search for books and organise them on three shelves: *Currently Reading* *Want to Read* and *Read*. The books can change shelves. 


### To get started:
* clone or download this repository and `cd` in the project folder
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start server with `npm start`. This will opena browser widow with the application running on port `3000`

### Live version
The live version of the app, built with gh-pages, is available [here](https://al3x4.github.io/myreads/). 

### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
